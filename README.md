# Welcome to the Foodu project
Foodu is a project developed by me, alone, I used it to study some interesting things about maps, geolocation, Haversine calculation, and other things. It's only a repository project and you can contribute or analyze it yourself, I use many different technologies to build this project, but I don't complicated things because it's a small project, and sometimes the complicated things complicate the codes haha.

In this project I tried to use the best things that I could learn from my job experience and the companies that I've been working on.

## About the project
In this project you can buy some food, add to your cart, favorite the food, and set your location, based on your location, the server will return the restaurants near you, you can choose the distance to find the restaurant near you setting the distance in kilometers. The server will calculate the distance based on the Haversine Formula and then return the restaurants.

About the app, initialy you see the onboarding screen, it's a simpatical screen with some description, after you can do the login with your credentials. When you are logged in, you need to configure your location, because we need this to find the restaurants, when you type the location and click on the search button, will appear some cards location, that the app searches for you. Select some card and will appear a MAP ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©. The map is to confirm your location, you can swipe or move it to another location.

Saving the location, you are already done, now you can see the restaurants results (if have some result into the server).

## Installation ðŸ’»
First you need to clone the server repository and configure then, if you don't know how configure or you don't understand, you can use the following server url:
